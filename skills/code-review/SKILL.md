# Comprehensive Code Review

Perform a thorough code review of the specified code, checking for security, performance, style, conventions, and best practices.

## Input

The target for review is provided as: `$ARGUMENTS`

Accepted inputs:
- **File path**: Review a specific file (e.g., `src/utils/auth.ts`) or directory containing source files
- **PR number**: Review a pull request (e.g., `#123` or `123`)
- **"staged"**: Review all currently staged git changes
- **"diff"**: Review unstaged changes in the working directory
- **"all"**: All code within the repository
- **No argument**: Ask the user what they want reviewed

## Review Categories

Analyze the code against each of these categories and report findings:

### 1. Security Vulnerabilities

Check for:
- Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, XSS, LDAP, etc.)
- Authentication and authorization flaws
- Sensitive data exposure (hardcoded secrets, credentials, API keys)
- Insecure cryptographic practices
- Missing input validation and sanitization
- Insecure deserialization
- Path traversal vulnerabilities
- CSRF vulnerabilities
- Improper error handling that leaks information
- OWASP Top 10 violations

### 2. Performance Issues

Check for:
- Inefficient algorithms (O(n²) when O(n) is possible, etc.)
- N+1 query problems
- Missing database indexes (when schema is available)
- Unnecessary re-renders (React, Vue, etc.)
- Memory leaks and resource cleanup issues
- Blocking operations in async contexts
- Excessive memory allocation
- Missing caching opportunities
- Inefficient data structures
- Unoptimized loops and iterations

### 3. Style Violations

Check for:
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Improper indentation and formatting
- Missing or excessive whitespace
- Line length violations
- Inconsistent brace/bracket style
- Import ordering issues
- Commented-out code that should be removed
- TODO/FIXME comments that need addressing
- Compliance with project linter rules (if config files exist)

### 4. Team Conventions

Look for project-specific patterns by examining:
- Existing code in the repository for established patterns
- Configuration files (.eslintrc, .prettierrc, pyproject.toml, etc.)
- Contributing guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Existing documentation
- Test patterns and naming conventions
- File and folder organization patterns
- Error handling patterns used elsewhere in codebase

Flag deviations from established team patterns.

### 5. Language Canonical Patterns

Check adherence to idiomatic patterns for the source language:
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Proper typing, async/await usage, module patterns
- **Python**: PEP 8, Pythonic idioms, type hints
- **Go**: Effective Go guidelines, error handling patterns
- **Rust**: Ownership patterns, Result/Option usage
- **Java**: Java conventions, design patterns
- **C#**: .NET conventions, LINQ usage
- (Apply similar standards for other languages)

### 6. Dependency Freshness

When new dependencies are added:
- Check if the dependency is actively maintained
- Verify the version is current (not outdated)
- Look for known vulnerabilities in the version
- Assess if the dependency is necessary or if native solutions exist
- Check license compatibility
- Evaluate the dependency's size and impact on bundle

### 7. Industry Best Practices

Check for:
- SOLID principles violations
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) violations
- Proper separation of concerns
- Appropriate error handling and logging
- Meaningful variable and function names
- Functions doing one thing well
- Appropriate abstraction levels
- Proper use of design patterns
- Documentation for public APIs
- Test coverage for new functionality

### 8. Code Duplication (DRY)

Scan for:
- Repeated code blocks within the reviewed files
- Similar logic that exists elsewhere in the codebase
- Copy-pasted code with minor variations
- Opportunities to extract common utilities
- Duplicated algorithms that could be consolidated
- Repeated patterns that warrant abstraction

## Output Format

Structure your review as follows:

```markdown
# Code Review: [target]

## Summary
[Brief 2-3 sentence overview of the code quality and main findings]

## Critical Issues 🔴
[Security vulnerabilities and bugs that must be fixed]

## Warnings 🟡
[Performance issues, potential bugs, and significant best practice violations]

## Suggestions 🔵
[Style improvements, minor optimizations, and nice-to-haves]

## Detailed Findings

### Security
[Findings or "No issues found"]

### Performance
[Findings or "No issues found"]

### Style
[Findings or "No issues found"]

### Team Conventions
[Findings or "No issues found"]

### Language Patterns
[Findings or "No issues found"]

### Dependencies
[Findings or "N/A - No new dependencies"]

### Best Practices
[Findings or "No issues found"]

### Code Duplication
[Findings or "No duplication detected"]

## Positive Observations ✅
[Note good practices and well-written code sections]
```

## Severity Levels

- **🔴 Critical**: Must fix before merge (security issues, bugs, broken functionality)
- **🟡 Warning**: Should fix (performance, maintainability, potential issues)
- **🔵 Suggestion**: Consider fixing (style, minor improvements)

## Instructions

1. If reviewing a file, read the file first
2. If reviewing a PR, use `gh pr diff [number]` to get the changes
3. If reviewing staged changes, use `git diff --cached`
4. If reviewing unstaged changes, use `git diff`
5. For context, examine related files in the codebase
6. Search for duplicated code patterns across the repository
7. Check for existing linter/formatter configurations
8. Provide specific line numbers for each finding
9. Include code snippets showing the issue and suggested fix
10. Be constructive and educational in feedback

## Edge Cases

- **Binary files**: Skip with note that binary files cannot be reviewed
- **Generated files**: Note if file appears generated and skip detailed review
- **Empty diff**: Report that there are no changes to review
- **Invalid file path**: Ask user to provide a valid path
- **PR not found**: Report error and ask for correct PR number
